## Installation

1. Navigate to the server directory:

cd server
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Start the development server:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

4. Start the production server:
\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

The server will run on `http://localhost:3001` by default.

## Rate Limiting Logic

- Each client IP is tracked individually
- 1 purchase allowed per 60-second window
- Rate limit resets after the time window expires
- Precise timing with remaining seconds provided in responses

## Production Considerations

- Replace in-memory storage with Redis or database
- Add authentication and user management
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Configure environment variables
- Add SSL/TLS encryption
- Implement proper database schema for purchase history
